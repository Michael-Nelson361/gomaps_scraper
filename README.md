# gomaps_scraper

This project explores a lightweight approach to gathering Google Maps search results without relying on official APIs. The goal is to automate a search query, collect each listing that appears, and save those details into a CSV file for later analysis or import into other tools.

The implementation is intentionally simple so it can be adapted to different workflows. Future iterations can focus on refining the scraping logic, handling edge cases in the Maps interface, and enriching the collected data before it is written to the CSV.
